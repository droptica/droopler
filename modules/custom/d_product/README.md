# Droopler Products Module

The Droopler Products module provides product
content type and related configuration.

## Setup
First, you need to download three dependant contrib modules:

* [Better Exposed Filters](https://www.drupal.org/project/better_exposed_filters)
* [Facets](https://www.drupal.org/project/facets)
* [Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api)

Using composer, run
`composer require drupal/better_exposed_filters drupal/facets drupal/search_api`
command.

In the next step, you need to enable
`d_product` module that comes with Droopler.
